Immute builds a starter template for developing full stack web apps with clojure and clojure script.

Immute is also the framework for producing full stack web apps, with strong opinions weakly held about what you should
do to create a full stack web app.

Some of the strongest opinions are:

  * No one should be railroaded into an implementation
    * Immute is easy to extend and compose. If it isn't, let us know
    * Q? We use stuartsierra/component to simplify access to dependencies
      * this does railroad composition

  * OM is sublime

  * Datomic is much better than traditional SQL RDBMSs

  * Ring And Bidi are all the web framework we need.

  * what else?

All of these opinions are held weakly. Tell us your opinions!
